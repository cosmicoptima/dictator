Hi Celeste
So about that "spending a bunch of credits for nothing" thing
i was thinking a thousand? since some people have just about that much
mostly thinking what would it (supposedly do)
it would be funny to have a command that was just "gullible" and it takes hundreds of credits from you and says there will be a reward next time
it could scale or something
have it state a percentage reward chance that increases towards 100
